EnviroMe is an app that allows users to scan items they have purchased in order to track their carbon footprint. This sustainability tracker enables you to monitor the environmental impact of the everyday products you buy, by calculating the average pollution produced during manufacturing, shipment, and consumption of the scanned product.
